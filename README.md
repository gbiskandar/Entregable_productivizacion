# Real Fake News
========================================================

This project consists of using a predictive data science model (XGBoost) to classify real news from other "fake" ones. The model is trained on a large kaggle dataset of real and fake news. The text is tokenized, vectorized, and stopwords eliminated to increase the accuracy of the model. Enjoy distinguishing real news from fake news. DISCLAIMER: The model is not accurate all the time, so please take the analysis as a suggestion, rather than a statement of fact.
